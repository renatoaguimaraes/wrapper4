# Wrapper for K8s Jobs + Sidecars

Sidecar containers do not works well with k8s jobs. The job will keep running so long as the sidecar proxy is running. This is a general problem not specific to Istio (see [kubernetes/kubernetes#25908](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/25908)). The typical sollution includes explicit terminate signaling between app and sidecar container such that the sidecar can exit when the app does.

***K8s Job wrapper*** is very simple and light weight program, written in golang, that start a desired process and execute a hook function to terminate the sidecar,  after process is finish. 

There is a hook implementation for Envoy Proxy sidecars,where a HTTP POST request is sent to http://localhost:15020/quitquitquit. This will gracefully shutdown both pilot-agent and the Envoy Proxy.

## Kubernetes Jobs

A [Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate. As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. 

## Istio Proxy Sidecar

[Sidecar](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/sidecar/) describes the configuration of the sidecar proxy that mediates inbound and outbound communication to the workload instance it is attached to.

## Job + Sidecar = Pod Status Pending

A Job is not considered complete until all containers have stopped running, and Istio Sidecars run indefinitely.

## Distroless Docker Images

In a distroless environment you donâ€™t have access to ```sleep``` or ```curl``` as suggested in [istio/issues/6324](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/6324).

## How to use

Wrapper build.
```
go build -a -o wrapper ./cmd/wrapper
```

The binary must be copied into the container and called by Docker ENTRYPOINT or by Kubernetes Job manifest, as you can see below.

[Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) example.

```dockerfile
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base:latest-amd64
...
ENTRYPOINT [ "/wrapper", "<your cmd>", "<arg 1>", "<arg 2>" ]
```

```shell
docker build . -t some-job-wrapper
```

Kubernetes Job.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
  labels:
    sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: some-job-wrapper
        command: [ "/wrapper", "<your cmd>", "<arg 1>", "<arg 2>" ]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

The [hook](./internal/hook/istio_proxy.go) for Istio Proxy sidecar will perform a request to http://localhost:15020/quitquitquit, a local administration interface that can be used to cleanly exit the server.
